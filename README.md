## 🧩 How Findr Works

1. **Report Lost Items**  
   Easily report your lost items with detailed descriptions and metadata (location, date, category).

2. **Register Found Items**  
   Found something? Register it so Findr can match it with someone’s lost report.

3. **Connect & Reclaim**  
   Our system helps match lost items with found ones, notifying the owners and allowing for safe recovery.
